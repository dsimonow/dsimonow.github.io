The Init Post. After a little push and shove I got a little blog running and not yet sure what will be posted here yet but Github Pages was something I wanted to try out atleast once and
it does look promising.
I used the [Github Docs][setting-up] for Github Pages to set this up. Pretty straight forward, give it a go if you too wanna make a quick blog and start writing!
This Blog runs on [Jekyll][jekyll-page] which also looks promising.
I still need to look into what theme and plugins I am gonna use and what this can do but a completely free hosting offering with a not even shitty default URL sounds good to me!

Well lets see what this thing can do!
